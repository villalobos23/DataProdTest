<h1>Purpose of the tool</h1>
<p>The purpose of this tool is to show how can shiny be used to handle interactive web based applications for statistical purposes, mainly the effect of variable selection in linear models and regression.</p>

<p>On the left side panel you have 4 options</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Number of Cars:</b>The amount of cars to be used to a total of 32</li>
  <li><b>Characteristic to use (x)</b> The variable to use as an independent variable</li>
  <li><b>Characteristic to use (y)</b> The variable to use as an dependent variable</li>
  <li><b>Use Intercept?</b> Whether to use an intercept or not for the analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>On the right hand we have several tabs</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observations - Detailed info about the observations</li>
  <li>Plot - plot of the fitted model</li>
  <li>Residuals - Residual plots of the fitted model</li>
  <li>Model Summary - Summary of the different values of the model</li>
  <li>Data Summary - Summary of the Variables selected</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding plots and summaries, they may change according to the type of the variables selected, if it is a category variable, like Transmission(am) or Cylinders(cyl) the plot created is a boxplot instead of the expected line plot.Another thing to note is that the variables usted to be on the y-axis should be numeric variables to obtain understandable results</p>

<h1>Dataset used</h1>
<p>taken from the mtcars dataset R helpfile (?mtcars)</p>
<p>The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).</p>
